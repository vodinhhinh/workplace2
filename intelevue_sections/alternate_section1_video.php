			<p>"Before we found [Intelevue], we were not able to provide management and staff our current hold time and total calls answered throughout the day without sending an email to all. Now, it is a simple matter of looking at the wallboards to know our status. It has truly made a difference by providing a real time look at the day's productivity." - Tana Perry, Louisiana Workforce Commission</p>

			<p>"Intelevue allows me to quickly respond to explosions in call volume by knowing exactly which areas need to be addressed, it doesn't take a PhD in mathematics to get straight to the needed information." - Theodore Zanick, UniSky</p>
